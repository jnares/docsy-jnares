 Background on the statistical concepts used

In this section we aim to provide with sufficient statistical background for both expert and non-expert users. For each concept, there is first a description in layman's terms (as much as possible) and then a more technical description often with mathematical formulas.

This section is divided in four sections. In the first section, _Introduction_, we present the most commonly used experimental designs and some basic concepts in the field like design matrix, model matrix, etc. The second, which is titled _Design quality indicators_, contains information on the multiple characteristics of a design. The third, titled _Design quality tradeoffs_, explains how some of the characteristics of a design conflict with each other. Finally, the fourth section, _Design comparison_, explains how we have approached the comparison and selection of competing designs in our software. 

Before you dive into this more theoretical part of the documentation, have a look at the following **glossary of terms**. 

* Experimental design:
* Quantitative factor:
* Categorical factor:
* Run or test:
* Screening experiment:
* Classical response surface design:
* Optimal design:
* DSD:
